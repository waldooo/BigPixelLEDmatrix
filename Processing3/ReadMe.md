# Processing Sketches

The sketch **WebCam_colorAveragePixels_to_Serial** is the most recent and uses a webcam to generate the images to be displayed in the LED matrix.

If you just want to test the serial communication, run the **static_image_AverageColor_Serial.pde**. The picture it uses is included with the data folder.
